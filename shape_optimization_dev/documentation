test_optimization: 
    1. a testing code for shape test_optimization
    2. we might want to change the default searching interval
        in "polysymeven_loss.m" if we use some other initialization
    3. (serialization) after **every** iteration, all statistics of 
        the optimization process is dumped in gd_log.mat
        usage:
            a = load('gd_log');
        explanation
            a.loss: losses in each iteration
            a.step: step size
            a.gradnorm: norm of gradient
            a.fdd: second derivative on gradient direction
            a.time: time for iteration
            a.weight: weight (i.e radii)
            a.grad: gradient
    4. stdout is dumped to diary.txt
    5. only files in this folder and "src" are required
